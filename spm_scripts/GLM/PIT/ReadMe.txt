GLM-01: no modulators / durations = 0  / 1st and 2nd level : 3 basic contrasts (R-C, R-N, Odor-NoOdor)

GLM-02: no modulators / durations = 1  / 1st and 2nd level : 3 basic contrasts

GLM-03: 1st level modulators /  durations = 1 /  Z-score for fsl.txt / 2nd level no modulators 
->  9 contrasts ( 3 basics + R-C^int/lik + R^int/lik-C^int/lik + R^int/lik-N^int/lik)

GLM-04: 1st level no modulators / durations = 1  / covariate 2nd level  (diff of the Z-scored_fsl.txt) 
-> 6 contrasts (3 basics X 2 covariate)
